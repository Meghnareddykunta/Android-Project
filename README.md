 <h2> Introduction to our Project:</h2>
<p>Cabbie is the sharing of car journeys so that more than one person travels in a car, and prevents the need for others to have to drive to a location themselves. We often travel long distances lonely which makes us bore besides costing more money.</p>
<p>This Application helps us in solving it along with other benefits like...
  <li>&nbsp  Save money. Share the costs of driving with other riders.</li>
  <li>&nbsp  Reduce stress. Read, listen to music, or relax when you’re not driving.</li>
  <li>&nbsp  Save time. As a carpool, you can drive in the HOV (high occupancy vehicle) lane.</li>
  <li>&nbsp  Help the environment. Carpooling creates cleaner air and safer communities.</li>
  <li>&nbsp  Prolong the life of your vehicle. Shared driving puts fewer miles on your own car.</li>
  <li>&nbsp  It reduces traffic. When three people carpool, there are two fewer cars on the road.</li>
