<h2> Introduction to our Project:</h2>
<p>Cabbie is the sharing of car journeys so that more than one person travels in a car, and prevents the need for others to have to drive to a location themselves. We often travel long distances lonely which makes us bore besides costing more money. This Application helps us in solving it along with other benefits like...
•	Save money. Share the costs of driving with other riders.
•	Reduce stress. Read, listen to music, or relax when you’re not driving.
•	Save time. As a carpool, you can drive in the HOV (high occupancy vehicle) lane.
•	Help the environment. Carpooling creates cleaner air and safer communities.
•	Prolong the life of your vehicle. Shared driving puts fewer miles on your own car.
•	It reduces traffic. When three people carpool, there are two fewer cars on the road.
